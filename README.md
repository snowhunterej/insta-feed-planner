# Insta Feed Planner

This project uses Vite, React and Tailwind CSS to demonstrate a simple Instagram planning grid.
Posts can be reordered via drag and drop, and clicking a post opens a modal where its status and tags can be edited.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the dev server

   npm run dev
   ```
